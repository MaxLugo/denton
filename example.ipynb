    "Denton procedure will interpolate high frequency data into low frecuency. Let be $I$ a vector indicator with high frecuency data from t=1 to T. Lets assume that $A_n$ is a vector of low frecuency data where $A_n$ represent the n period and is length N. So the objetive is interpolate the vector $I$ into $A$. Lets assume that the length of I divide by A is equal to q (if q=4 => that is annual data with quarterly data). Lets assume that q=4.\n",
